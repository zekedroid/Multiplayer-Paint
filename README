The executable jar files are in the executables directory.

To start the server you use the command 
"java -jar WhiteboardServer.jar [--port PORT]" 

which allows the optional argument PORT,
specifying the port the server will be listening on,

and to start the client you use the command 

"java -jar WhiteboardClient.jar [--ip IP] [--port PORT]" 

which allows you to specify the IP
and PORT address of the server.

If not specified, IP will default to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and PORT
will default to 4444.
